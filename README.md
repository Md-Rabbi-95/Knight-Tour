he Knight’s Tour project is a computational simulation that explores one of the classic problems in chess and algorithm design. The goal is to move a knight across a standard 8×8 chessboard (or boards of different sizes) in such a way that it visits every square exactly once.

This project implements the Knight’s Tour using well-known algorithms such as:

Backtracking
Warnsdorff’s Rule (Heuristic Algorithm)# Knight-Tour
